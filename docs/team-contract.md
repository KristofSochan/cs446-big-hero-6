# Team Contract

This is the team contract for Big Hero 6

## Roles

All members can take individual tasks within these divisions (i.e. anyone can take on frontend, backend, NFC, etc. tasks), but the lead for that division serves as the person in-command and organizer for that portion of our project.

- Kristof is our team lead, and is responsible for coordinating the project, deliverables, and meetings.
- Owen is our technical lead, and is responsible for technical documentation, architecture diagrams, etc.
- XXX leads the front-end development for the app.
- Kushal leads the back-end database development, including database work
- Anees will lead the integration of the physical NFC tags into the app

Other role ideas:

- The example contract had a "testing lead", but an alternative can be that everyone will be responsible for their own tests eventually (backend tests, NFC tests, frontend tests, etc)
- We could split the technical lead role to have a dedicated role for someone who works on the architecture deliverables for the course

## Communication

- Our team will use a Discord group chat to communicate project-related matters.
- We will meet **every week on Wednesday after CS 446 Lecture 001 (11:20am-12:00pm) in or near MC 4021**
- We are also generally available and can have more informal discussion after class on Monday (11:20am-12:00pm) in or near MC 4021

## Meetings

### Meeting agenda

1. Review GitHub Project board for ongoing tasks by member
   - What everyone has accomplished
   - What's next for each member

2. Ensure that the team is working effectively towards course deadlines

### Meeting rules

- All members will attend the weekly Wednesday meeting or notify the team in advance of anticipated absences. We all agree that absences should be rare.
- All group members will come to the meetings prepared by:
  - being aware of the general state of the project as of the last meeting
  - coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
- Members will be engaged during the meetings
- Decisions can be made during meetings even if some members are absent.
- Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions.

- Kristof will take notes during all meetings and post notes in docs/meeting_minutes.

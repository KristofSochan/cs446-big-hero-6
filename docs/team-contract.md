# Team Contract

This is the team contract for Big Hero 6

## Roles

- Kristof is our team lead, and is responsible for coordinating the project, deliverables, and meetings.
- Owen is our technical lead, and is responsible for technical documentation, architecture diagrams, etc.
- XXX leads the front-end development for the app.
- Kushal leads the back-end database development, including database work
- Anees will lead the integration of the physical NFC tags into the app

Other role ideas:

All members can take individual tasks within these divisions (i.e. anyone can take on frontend, backend, NFC, etc. tasks), but the lead for that division serves as the person in-command and organizer for that portion of our project.

## Communication

- Our team will use Discord group chat to communicate project-related matters.
- We will meet every week on Wednesday after CS 446 Lecture 001 (11:20am-12:00pm) in or near MC 4021\*
- We are also generally available and can have more informal discussion after class on Monday (11:20am-12:00pm) in or near MC 4021

## Meetings

### Meeting agenda
1. Review of kanban board for ongoing tasks by member
2. Discuss deadlines

### Meeting rules

- All members will attend these meetings or notify the team in advance of anticipated absences. We all agree that absences should be rare.
- All group members will come to the meetings prepared by:
  - awareness of the state of the project since last meeting
  - coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
- Members will not work on other assignments during meetings and will be engaged.
- Decisions can be made during meetings even some members are absent.
- Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions.

- Kristof will take notes during all meetings.
